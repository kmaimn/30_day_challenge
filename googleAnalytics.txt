1. Google analytics

2. Components: collection, configuration, processing, reporting

        collection: collect user-interaction data
        config/processing/reporting: access to data

3. JavaScript library (prewritten js which allows easier development of js-based applications)

4. Analytics for...
        Websites/Web Apps
        Mobile Apps

5. Websites/Web Apps...
        analytics.js : measures how users will interact with your website/web app

6. Websites/Mobile Apps/Devices will have something called a propertyID, unique identifier used for tracking;

7. Tracking snippets are sourced in a script tag - add it to every page that you want tracked

      Partials?

8. Does a bunch of stuff, but essentially defines a global function GA as a command queue that will get information for you and store it until you are ready to use it (i think..)

9. GA() is a function that is also an object, so with that it has properties;

10. Developer side, you can configure a lot of information that you want from the site (i think..)

11. My experience is a dashboard (show a pic)

12. Type of data analytics collects:
        -The total time a user spends on your site.
        -The time a user spends on each page and in what order those pages were visited.
        -What internal links were clicked (based on the URL of the next pageview).
        -The geographic location of the user.
        -What browser and operating system are being used.
        -Screen size and whether Flash or Java is installed.
        -The referring site.
